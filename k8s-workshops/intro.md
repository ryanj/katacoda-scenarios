This is a playground for trying out OpenShift 3.7. From here you can play
with OpenShift using the web console or command line.

The environment is currently providing a sneak peek at OpenShift 3.7 using
the 3.7 release candidate (3.7-rc.0) and not the final released version.
Some features may not be fully enabled. Features known not to be enabled
are:

* Template service broker.

## What are playgrounds?

Playgrounds give you a pre-configured environment to start playing and
exploring using an unstructured learning approach. They are great for
experimenting with OpenShift, including trying to deploy your own
application code.

The playground will be available for 60 minutes after which time it will
be destroyed.
